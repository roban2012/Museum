Michelangelo <br><br>

Trifles make perfection, and perfection is no trifle. <br><br>

Carving is easy; you just go down to the skin and stop. <br><br>

I saw an angel in the block of marble and I just chiseled until I set him free. <br><br>

Statue of David, "It is easy. You just chip away the stone that doesn't look like David." <br><br>

Beauty is the purgation (purge) of superfluities 多余. Genius is eternal patience. <br><br>


Picasso<br><br>

Art is the elimination of the unnecessary. <br><br>

Every act of creation is first an act of destruction. <br><br>

All children are artists. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up. <br><br>

Bad artists copy. Good artists steal. <br><br>

I do not seek. I find. <br><br>
