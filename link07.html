A Brief History of the Future

Thomas Cole, Le Destin des empires : Destruction, 1836 - 140 * 87 px

This exhibition―one of the most anticipated at the Louvre in 2015―is based on the book by Jacques Attali of the same name (Une brève histoire de l’avenir), published in 2006. Pluridisciplinary, it brings a number of contemporary artists into a dialogue with noteworthy works from different eras, retracing in the present an account of the past conducive to a clearer view of the future.

Musée du Louvre, until January 4, 2016
